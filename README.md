# huinga
Forum software in Javascript

The word Huinga is Maori(an?) for Forum.

Why Maori? Better question is, can I pronounce my own project?

Regardless, what is Huinga (this thingie)? 
Answer: a Javascript forum software

Most of the forum software that exists now are in PHP. Which is fine, but I hate PHP. And I always believe I can do better, so now is my chance to prove to myself that I can do better.
